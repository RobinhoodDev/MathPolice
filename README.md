# Math Police.
My first game! Entirely made with Python and a "Calculator" made with Java, I hope you enjoy!
# Basic Instructions
There are different difficulties.
You can choose what difficulty you want by responding to the difficulty input prompt with, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Insane", "Godlike", or "Boss Word 1".

# Prerequisites:


You must have Python 3.

# Rules:

DO NOT ANSWER PROBLEMS USING ANY CAPITAL LETTERS. It will be counted as incorrect.

You must translate words into numerical values.
You translate words letter by letter.
The value of a letter corresponds to their order in the alphabet.
For example, A is the first letter in the alphabet so A = 1
and B is the second letter in the alphabet so B = 2 and so on and so on.
To translate a word, you must add up the values of each letter.
So the word "in" Would be equal to 9 + 14, because i is the 9th letter in the alphabet and n is the 14th.

# Difficulties:


Easy: 3 to 6-letter words.

Medium: 7 to 9-letter words

Hard: 10 to 12-letter words

Insane: 13 to 16-letter words

Godlike: 27-45 letter words

Boss Word 1: 183 letters

Final Boss: In progress

# Extras:
Attached In the main branch is a file called "The Calculating Method". This is the java code used to calculate the "Word Value" (The numerical value of the word in this game)
# Credits:
A great thanks to my brother for making the calculating method for my game. Without it, I don't think i would have had a chance at trying to complete the Final Boss Word.
