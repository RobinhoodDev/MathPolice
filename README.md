# Math Police.
My first game! Entirely made with Python and a "Calculator" made with Java, I hope you enjoy!
# Basic Instructions
There are different difficulties.
You can choose what difficulty you want by responding to the difficulty input prompt with, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard", "Insane", "Godlike", or "Boss Word 1".

# Prerequisites:
You must have Python 3.
I also recommend Jgrasp if you want to run the Game Calculator.

# Rules:

DO NOT ANSWER PROBLEMS USING ANY CAPITAL LETTERS. It will be counted as incorrect.

You must translate words into numerical values.
You translate words letter by letter.
The value of a letter corresponds to their order in the alphabet.
For example, A is the first letter in the alphabet so A = 1
and B is the second letter in the alphabet so B = 2 and so on and so on.
To translate a word, you must add up the values of each letter.
So the word "in" Would be equal to 9 + 14, because i is the 9th letter in the alphabet and n is the 14th.

# Difficulties:

### World 1:

Easy: 3 to 6-letter words.

Medium: 7 to 9-letter words

Hard: 10 to 12-letter words

Insane: 13 to 16-letter words

Godlike: 27-45 letter words

Boss Word 1: 183 letters

##### I have decided not word sizes and difficuties for Worlds 2-4 YET.
# Extras:
Attached In the main branch is a file called "The Calculating Method". This is the java code used to calculate the "Word Value" (The numerical value of the word in this game). I would also like to mention a few things.
This java code seems to only work with this online compiler:
https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler
And, you can only use lowercase letters.

# OST Importing:
When the update gets released, the OST will be added to the project. We recommend getting PyCharm. Run Math Police using PyCharm. Then move the songs from the folder into the PycharmProject that contains the game. 
It should look like this:

Then the music for each world should play when you open the file and choose the world!
# Credits:
A great thanks to my brother for making the calculating method for my game. Without it, I don't think i would have had a chance at trying to complete the Final Boss Word.
